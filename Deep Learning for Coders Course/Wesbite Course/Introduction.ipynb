    "Each lesson features a video, which all feature transcripts. Each video covers a chapter from within the book, which I will also work through simultaneously to consolidate and revise after completing each unit of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will heavilly use Jupyter Notebooks (what you are looking at right now!), which allows for the flexible deployment of Data Science and Machine Learning programs, and also allows for a good set of notes to complement via the Markdown integretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be doing everything on my own machine (as I own a machine with a nice Nvidia GPU, which is necessary for general Machine Learning tasks, being a 2060 Super). The setup required is relatively simple, and can be done by following the setup instructions from https://docs.fast.ai/. If you are not able to use your own hardware consider the following (this is copied from the course):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Colab (https://course.fast.ai/start_colab): A popular free service from Google. Google have changed the notebook platform quite a lot, so keyboard shortcuts are different, and not everything works (e.g. much of chapter 2 doesn't work because Colab doesn't support creating web app GUIs)\n",
    "* Gradient (https://course.fast.ai/start_gradient): Unlike Colab, this is a \"real\" Jupyter Notebook so everything in the course works. It also provides space to save your notebooks and models. However, sometimes the free servers get over-loaded, and when that happens it's impossible to connect."

These include the social and physical sciences, the arts, medicine, finance, scientific research, and many more. Here's a list of some of the thousands of tasks in different areas at which deep learning, or methods heavily using deep learning, is now the best in the world:\n",
