# Fast.ai Course

I'll be using this repository to hosue all of the notes that I take during my time taking the official Fastai courses, and aim to finish all the courses to learn more about Deep Learning, and if it is right for me.

## Progress:

This table will indicate which courses I am currently working on, for easier reference as to what is finished, and what I am still working on. Will update as I go through more courses.

For now I will go through the courses one at a time (there being 5 at the time of writing this), which each having it's own table here as I start working on it.

## Where to find all my notes?

Just go into source code, and everything will be sorted into notes for each lesson, and a document with the answer for each lesson. As I also go through all the quizzes on the course, I'll upload those on here as well. Feel free to look through these notes in your own journey through these courses!
